Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1s in the array.

A binary array is an array that contains only 0s and 1s.

Examples:
1. Input: nums = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The maximum consecutive 1s are present from index 4 to index 6, amounting to 3 1s

2. Input: nums = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: 0
Explanation:
No 1s are present in nums, thus we return 0
