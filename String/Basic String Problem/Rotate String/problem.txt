Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

Examples:
1. Input : s = "abcde" , goal = "cdeab"
Output : true
Explanation :
After performing 2 shifts we can achieve the goal string from string s.
After first shift the string s is => bcdea
After second shift the string s is => cdeab.

2. Input : s = "abcde" , goal = "adeac"
Output : false
Explanation :
Any number of shift operations cannot convert string s to string goal.
