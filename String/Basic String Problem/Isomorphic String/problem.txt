Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Examples:
1. Input : s = "egg" , t = "add"
Output : true
Explanation :
The 'e' in string s can be replaced with 'a' of string t.
The 'g' in string s can be replaced with 'd' of t.
Hence all characters in s can be replaced to get t.

2. Input : s = "apple" , t = "bbnbm"
Output : false
Explanation :
It can be proved that no solution exists for this example.
All the "b"s in t have to take places of "a", "p", "l", which requires "p" to be mapped to "b", but that makes it impossible for "p" at index 2 (0-indexed) to become "n". Thus no solution exists.
