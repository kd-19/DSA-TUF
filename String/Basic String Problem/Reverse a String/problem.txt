Given a string, the task is to reverse it. The string is represented by an array of characters s. Perform the reversal in place with O(1) extra memory.

Note: no need to return anything, modify the given list.

Examples:
1. Input : s = ["h", "e" ,"l" ,"l" ,"o"]
Output : ["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]
Explanation : The given string is s = "hello" and after reversing it becomes s = "olleh".

2. Input : s = ["b", "y" ,"e" ]
Output : ["e", "y", "b"]
Explanation : The given string is s = "bye" and after reversing it becomes s = "eyb".
