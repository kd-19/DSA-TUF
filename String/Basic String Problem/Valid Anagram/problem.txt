Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Examples:
1. Input : s = "anagram" , t = "nagaram"
Output : true
Explanation :
We can rearrange the characters of string s to get string t as frequency of all characters from both strings is same.

2. Input : s = "dog" , t = "cat"
Output : false
Explanation :
We cannot rearrange the characters of string s to get string t as frequency of all characters from both strings is not same.
