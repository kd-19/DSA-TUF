Given an integer num, return true if it is prime otherwise false.

A prime number is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

Examples:
1. Input : num = 5
Output : true
Explanation : The factors of 5 are 1 and 5 only.
So it satisfies the prime number condition.

2. Input : num = 15
Output : false
Explanation : The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15 only.
As the number has factors other than 1 and itself, So it is not a prime number.
