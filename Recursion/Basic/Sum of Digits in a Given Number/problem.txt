Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

Examples:
1. Input : num = 529
Output : 7
Explanation : In first iteration the digits sum will be = 5 + 2 + 9 => 16
In second iteration the digits sum will be 1 + 6 => 7.
Now single digit is remaining , so we return it.

2. Input : num = 101
Output : 2
Explanation : In first iteration the digits sum will be = 1 + 0 + 1 => 2
Now single digit is remaining , so we return it.
