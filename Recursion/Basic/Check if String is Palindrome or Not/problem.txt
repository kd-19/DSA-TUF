Given a string s, return true if the string is palindrome, otherwise false.

A string is called palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.

Examples:
1. Input : s = "hannah"
Output : true
Explanation : The string when reversed is --> "hannah", which is same as original string , so we return true.

2. Input : s = "aabbaaa"
Output : false
Explanation : The string when reversed is --> "aaabbaa", which is not same as original string, So we return false.
