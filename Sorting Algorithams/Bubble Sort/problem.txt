#Intuition
The bubble sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The largest elements "bubble" to the end of the array with each pass.

#Approach
1. Run a loop i from n-1 to 0.
2. Run a nested loop from j from 0 to i-1.
3. If arr[j] > arr[j+1], swap them.
4. Continue until the array is sorted.

#Note: Here, after each iteration, the array becomes sorted up to the last index of the range. That is why the last index of the range decreases by 1 after each iteration. This decrement is managed by the outer loop, where the last index is represented by the variable i. The inner loop (variable j) helps to push the maximum element of the range [0...i] to the last index (i.e., index i).



Given an array of integers called nums,sort the array in non-decreasing order using the bubble sort algorithm and return the sorted array.

A sorted array in non-decreasing order is an array where each element is greater than or equal to all preceding elements in the array.

Examples:
1. Input: nums = [7, 4, 1, 5, 3]
Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
Explanation: 1 <= 3 <= 4 <= 5 <= 7.
Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. Input: nums = [5, 4, 4, 1, 1]
Output: [1, 1, 4, 4, 5]
Explanation: 1 <= 1 <= 4 <= 4 <= 5.
Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
