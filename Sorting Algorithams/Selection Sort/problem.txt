#Intuition
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The largest element will end up at the last index of the array.

#Approach
1. Select the starting index of the unsorted part using a loop with i from 0 to n-1.
2. Find the smallest element in the range from i to n-1 using an inner loop.
3. Swap this smallest element with the element at index i.
4. Repeat the process for the next starting index.




Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in non-decreasing order using the selection sort algorithm and return the sorted array.

A sorted array in non-decreasing order is an array where each element is greater than or equal to all previous elements in the array.

Examples:
1. Input: nums = [7, 4, 1, 5, 3]
Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
Explanation: 1 <= 3 <= 4 <= 5 <= 7.
Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. Input: nums = [5, 4, 4, 1, 1]
Output: [1, 1, 4, 4, 5]
Explanation: 1 <= 1 <= 4 <= 4 <= 5.
Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
